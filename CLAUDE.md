**Note**: This project uses [bd (beads)](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads)
for issue tracking. Use `bd` commands instead of markdown TODOs.
See AGENTS.md for workflow details.

## Git workflow
- Commit changes after each logical completion
- Always stage and commit new files - never leave untracked files
- Use descriptive commit messages
